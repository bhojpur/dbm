// BasicComparer is the interface that wraps the basic Compare method.
type BasicComparer interface {
	// Compare returns -1, 0, or +1 depending on whether a is 'less than',
	// 'equal to' or 'greater than' b. The two arguments can only be 'equal'
	// if their contents are exactly equal. Furthermore, the empty slice
	// must be 'less than' any non-empty slice.

// than' relationship.

	// Separator appends a sequence of bytes x to dst such that a <= x && x < b,
	// where 'less than' is consistent with Compare. An implementation should

	// may cause corruption on the internal state.

	// 'less than' is consistent with Compare. An implementation should return

	// Contents of b should not by any means modified. Doing so may cause
	// corruption on the internal state.
